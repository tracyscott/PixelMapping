The first toggle for each output determines the currently selected output.

The second toggle for each output toggles the display of the given output.

Pressing *space* adds the currently selected point (highlighted in blue) to the wiring of the currently selected output.

Arrow keys can be used for navigation.

Backspace will remove the last added point.

Left mouse click will set the currently selected point to the point under the mouse cursor.

'l' will lock add-while-moving mode.  This allows you to add points while moving with the arrow
keys which can be less tedious.  Occasionally you will need to press 'l' again to toggle the mode off
so you can navigate without adding wiring.  To start running another wire from a different output, 
select a new output on the right side of the screen.

'p' toggles print mode.  Changes the background to white for easier printing to paper.  Should be used
with the hide/show toggles to print a reference sheet for each output independently.
